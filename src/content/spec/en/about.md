# About me

I have been working as a web engineer since 2019. I started my career as an R&D engineer, then worked as a backend engineer, and recently have been focusing on SRE and platform engineering.
I have expertise in SRE-related tasks such as error rate improvement and thorough O11y (Observability), as well as platform engineering areas including technology infrastructure renewal and maintenance. I am also skilled in backend development using statically typed languages such as Go and Rust.

I also focus on OSS contributions and have experience working with organizations like Rust, GNOME, and Node.js.
In particular, I am one of the most active Japanese contributors to Rust as of June 2025 (according to [Thanks](https://thanks.rust-lang.org), which aggregates contributions on GitHub).

Currently, I have availability for side projects and contract work. Please contact me via [email](mailto:huyuumi.dev@gmail.com).
