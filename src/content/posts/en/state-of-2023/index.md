I fell asleep watching a LoL stream, and when I woke up, the new year had begun. Here are my reflections and resolutions.

## Travel

Hokkaido, Kanto, Kansai, South Kyushu, and Korea—I visited a lot of places.

Tokyo in particular has a high concentration of great hotels, which I love, but since moving, I’ve barely gone. Traveling light is nice enough, but in the end, I finished 2023 without finding the chance.

In 2024, I hope to set foot abroad—despite the weak yen.

## Moving

In the height of summer, I moved to Tokyo.

In the first half of 2023, I had many occasions to go to Tokyo, and the hassle of preparing for each trip piled up—among other reasons—and I ended up moving.

Like a typical newcomer to the big city, I’m impressed every day by the convenience. There are frequent events, and it’s a blessing to be able to go on a whim.

I also go out more often now, and since everything’s close by, I wander around a lot. I maintain my unhealthiness by increasing my smoking in proportion to the health I gain from walking.

## Work

At my current job, I organized and kicked off the platform team.

I’m trying a lot of things, and I enjoy operating like a utility player—so I’m happy.

I also spoke with many people outside the company.

Putting aside the technical side, many people disliked the mismatch in behavior and my mental instability. It also means I didn’t have enough “power” or reassurance to overturn that impression.

There was a turning point in my life, but I missed it, as I tend to blow it at critical moments.

I have a habit of valuing my own internal rules—like the order I wash my body, or which shoe I put on first—and this time I made a choice that broke those, which left me with a regret I can’t shake. When I go against my intuition, I feel great regret no matter the outcome. A lesson learned.

## OSS

Since I started side gigs, I’ve had less time to devote to contributions, and as a result, progress hasn’t followed as much.

I managed to keep reviews going without much delay, so it wasn’t disastrous, but I ultimately failed to achieve my 2023 goal of a major release of the libc crate.

However, I’ve created a roadmap and TODO list, and have a rough plan, so hopefully 2024 is the year.

Economically, I tend to prioritize side gigs that provide relatively stable income. Unless I increase the rest—including my main job—it’s frustrating because I can’t change the current situation.

## 2024

I’ll focus on survival.

I still fear that my consciousness can go blank, but I want to learn a way of letting go, like Natori’s views on life and death and end-of-life.

For now, I think I’ll look for a song to play at my funeral.
