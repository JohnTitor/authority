If it’s still just barely acceptable to talk about New Year’s resolutions, then it’s also just barely acceptable to look back on last year.

## Work / Engineering

### Day job

I changed jobs. At my new job, I’m still working in the platform engineering space. Considering various things at work and in my personal life, I think it was a year aimed at “stability.”

I know that FLOSS activity looks good on a CV and can become a kind of “fanfare,” but I’ve been mindful not to benefit from that right out of the gate. As a newcomer—or, if I put it bluntly, an outsider—I mustn’t forget what I am. I put a lot of effort into learning and trying things that help me coexist with the organization.

It feels like the first big mountain is about to bear fruit, so I want to stay sharp and see it through.

Separately, I’ve also started thinking more about influence and impact. Given my title and grade, the share of work that expects me to have a positive impact on others has grown, and I’m scrambling to step up to it.

In terms of output, I wrote about three posts on the company blog:

- [Zenn article 1](https://zenn.dev/moshjp/articles/4f91ad6f40a7bf)
- [Zenn article 2](https://zenn.dev/moshjp/articles/119b0c7a1dd585)
- [Zenn article 3](https://zenn.dev/moshjp/articles/89210853cd4dc9)

I also appeared on a podcast:

This year as well, I’d like to keep writing and/or speaking.

My previous job was a very fun workplace, and my current job is no less so—I’ve been able to spend my days happily. Grateful.

### FLOSS

I’d say I did a decent amount. I shipped a few major releases of libraries I maintain, and tried making various things through “vibe coding.”

In this era, being able to quickly give shape to what you want to build is incredibly convenient. It’s like the range of things you can write-and-throw-away has expanded. Of course, there are many things I don’t throw away, too.

I haven’t really managed much outward reach. My twisted “anti-monetization” kind of frugality mindset still gets in the way.

This year, I also started to feel (tentatively) like I might try harder—for example, giving a conference talk on FLOSS topics—so I want to cultivate that.

Things I haven’t done well: lately my reviews have been piling up, so I want to respond without making people wait too long, and I also want to gradually restart contributions around Rust.

## Personal

I already mentioned it, but “stability” pretty much sums up the year. Thanks to that, I’ve gotten quite used to my new life.

I also improved my living environment so that cooking and housework are comfortable, and I’ve been able to live quite thoughtfully. I wouldn’t have believed it a year ago.

I also played a ton of games.

FF16 and Cyberpunk 2077 were reliably great, and I dug deep into indie games like Schedule I and Balatro as well. My personal GOTY was The Planet Crafter—the timing of unlocking new elements was perfect, and the experience (including the catharsis) was wonderful. Highly recommended.

### Going forward

Regardless of day job or FLOSS, one of the things I want to work on this year is reaching outward more.

And I also want to push forward hard on what I’m doing at work. I have a feeling that what I do over the next year or two will meaningfully change the scenery—for both me and the company. I’ll keep laying the groundwork, and if I can produce something I can show externally, I want to promote it.
