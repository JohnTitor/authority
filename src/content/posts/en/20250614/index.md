I left Canary at the end of April 2025 and joined MOSH in May. Now that things have settled down, I’d like to jot down a short entry about the transition.

## What I did at Canary

After spending my first year as a backend engineer, I switched to a platform engineer role as the platform team launched.

At the very beginning, I was the only full-time member, and it was a field with few precedents, so I started out groping in the dark. Since then, the team has grown and the work has accumulated.
I did a lot of gritty work, from IaC and CI security hardening to migrations of k8s clusters/GAR/third-party services, reducing error rates, and strengthening O11y in an SRE-ish fashion.

The working environment was excellent as well. I had autonomy over office/remote work, and there were solid benefits like support for using generative AI tools.

## Why did I leave?

Passion won out.
On an internal level, I have strong self-affirmation when I can provide value that only I can. That chord was struck.
As Kiritsugu said, helping someone means not helping someone else.
Canary’s platform team had reached a point where it could run without me, unlike two years ago, and I could leave with peace of mind.
Seeking an environment where I could help more directly led to this job change.

## What’s next?

I joined MOSH in May 2025.

At MOSH, I’m a SWE on the Productivity team, working on improvements starting with the technical foundation. The overall scope isn’t drastically different, but the scenery is somewhat new and refreshing.

I hope to produce externally visible results soon—and keep pushing.
